# RPIM: Relative Proportion of sites with Intermediate Methylation

RPIM is a score that measures the epigenetic heterogeneity in a bisulfite sequencing sample. Under the assumption that a homogeneous sample will have mostly CpGs with either 100% or 0% DNA methylation, it follows that the proportion of sites that differ from these two extremes can be used as a measure of sample heterogeneity.

Description: Provides a score called PIM that measures the epigenetic
    heterogeneity in a bisulfite sequencing sample. Under the assumption that a
    homogeneous sample will have mostly CpGs with either 100% or 0% DNA methylation,
    it follows that the proportion of sites that differ from these two extremes can
    be used as a measure of sample heterogeneity.
